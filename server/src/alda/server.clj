   playing a score). We want the worker to finish what it's doing and then shut
   down.

   To do this, we...
   - remove it from the queue
   - temporarily 'blacklist' its address so it won't be re-queued the next time
     it sends a heartbeat
   - in a separate thread, wait a safe amount of time and then remove the
     address from the blacklist; this is to keep the blacklist from growing too
     big over time

   Once the worker is out of the queue and we aren't letting it back in, the
   worker will stop getting heartbeats from the server and shut itself down."
